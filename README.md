# Professional README Generator

The Professional README Generator is a command-line application designed to create a high-quality README file for open source projects on GitHub. The Generator will explain the purpose of the app, guiding its installation and use, and encouraging contributions.

This Node.js application utilizes the Inquirer package to solicit input from the user, transforming their responses into a professional, structured README.md file. The generated README includes essential sections such as a project description, table of contents, installation instructions, usage guidelines, license information, contribution procedures, test instructions, and contact information. This automated approach saves valuable time for developers, allowing them to focus more on the development of the project itself.

Key features include:

- Dynamic generation of a README.md file from user input.
- Customization options for project title, description, installation, usage, and more.
- License selection from a predefined list, automatically adding a corresponding badge and legal notice.
- Integration of the user's GitHub profile and contact information for easy reach out and collaboration.

## User Story 
As a developer, I want a README generator so that I can quickly create a professional README for new projects.

## Getting Started 
1. Clone the [starter code repository] (https://github.com/coding-boot-camp/potential-enigma)and create your own repository with it (do not fork).
2. Create a .gitignore file to exclude node_modules/ and .DS_Store/ from tracking.
3. Initialize your project with npm init and install the Inquirer package using npm i inquirer@8.2.4.
4. Run the application using the command node index.js.
5. Follow the command-line prompts to input your project details.
